    Make fork and commit of https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-net/blob/8.0/MySQL.Data/src/MySqlHelper.cs
        Fix MySqlHelper to take CommandType allowing StoredProcs to run properly

Bugs:
    Update Tracking to log as DateTime (not Date)
    Add Capacity to delete meals (Remove when RemainingWeight Drops <= 0)
        When MealTrackingRecord is removed increase Meal RemainingWeight by Quantity

    Check Update/Add StoredProcs what happens if values are null?

    Update stored proc UpdateMealTrackingRecord to ensure RemainingWeight is updated in relation to change of $Quantity
    not as a flat value of the input $Quantity parameter
