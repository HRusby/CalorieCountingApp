Bugs:
    Adding meals to past dates
    Make sure the remaining weight is updated when a serving is taken
    Fix API ADao to open a connection on each request to prevent them from going stale
    Add Capacity to delete meals (Remove when RemainingWeight Drops <= 0)
        When MealTrackingRecord is removed increase Meal RemainingWeight by Quantity
    Update CalorieTracking to ensure TrackingRecord uses DateTime not Date

    Check Update/Add StoredProcs what happens if values are null?

    Update stored proc UpdateMealTrackingRecord to ensure RemainingWeight is updated in relation to change of $Quantity
    not as a flat value of the input $Quantity parameter
