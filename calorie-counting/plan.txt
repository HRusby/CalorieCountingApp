Bugs:
    Update Tracking to log as DateTime (not Date)
    Fix API ADao to open a connection on each request to prevent them from going stale
    Add Capacity to delete meals (Remove when RemainingWeight Drops <= 0)
        When MealTrackingRecord is removed increase Meal RemainingWeight by Quantity

    Check Update/Add StoredProcs what happens if values are null?

    Update stored proc UpdateMealTrackingRecord to ensure RemainingWeight is updated in relation to change of $Quantity
    not as a flat value of the input $Quantity parameter
